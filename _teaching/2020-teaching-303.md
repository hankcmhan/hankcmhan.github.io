An introductory analog and digital circuits course allows students to learn the fundamental principles of operation of the circuits that are based on active devices such as MOSFET and Bipolar Transistors, which provide amplification. 

As a teaching assistant, I have to conduct discussion session and office hours every week, to summarize week notes for students, and prepare for exercise problems that help the students understand how to use theories and concepts learned in class.
