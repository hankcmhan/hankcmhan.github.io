Chang-Mu Han is currently a PhD candidate at Institute of Research in Electronics and Applied Physics in University of Maryland. He received his BS degree of mechanical engineering in Yuan Ze University in 2007 and his MS degree of applied mechanics in National Taiwan University in 2009. 

I am primarily interested in research at the intersection of machine learning and control systems in modeling, design, and optimization for applications in optomechatronic and biomedical practice. I focus on applications where control and learning theory can significantly improve new system capabilities. My goal is to formulate the initial applications goals as tractable control problems, and demonstrate practicable approaches to the problems by system modeling, control algorithm development, and experimental validation.
